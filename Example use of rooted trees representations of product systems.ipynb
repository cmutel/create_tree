    "### Introduction:\n",
    "LCI databases built from unit process data can be very large. For example, ecoinvent v3.2 (cut-off) has 12,916 activities (unit processes), 116,248 technosphere flows (intermediary exchanges) and 343,020 biosphere exchanges (elementary flows).  \n",
    "Consequently, the resulting product systems that are built for specific LCA that *use* the LCI databases are also significantly large.  \n",
    "LCI databases built from unit process data also have cyclic dependency relationships, or *feedback loops*. For example, Electricity distribution is needed for aluminium production, and aluminium is needed for electricity distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are cases where one could (1) want to reduce the size of one's product system, without losing any of the contributions to the total LCIA scores, or (2) have product systems where every instance of an activity is modeled as an independent unit process. Really, its true. This is why we did this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on ideas presented in [Bourgault et al. 2012](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-012-0418-7), a \"Tree\" class was created that converts product systems modeled in the Brightway2 LCA framework into rooted tree representations of the same product systems.\n",
    "  - The root is the unit process providing the functional unit.\n",
    "  - All branches (i.e. internal nodes) are unit processes whose cradle-to-gate contributions are greater than a specified threshold (the \"cutoff\") for a given list of methods.\n",
    "  - All other unit processes are considered leaves.\n",
    "  - Leaves can be:\n",
    "      * \"entry points\" to a disaggregated background LCI database\n",
    "      * Datasets produced on the fly containing only LCIA scores\n",
    "  - The resulting branch and leaf nodes are written to a new database.\n",
    "  - The tree.root can then be used to create LCA objects as would normally be done in Brightway."
